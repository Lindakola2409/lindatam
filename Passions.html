                <h1>Baking</h1>
                <p>Since the I was ten, I have immersed myself in the art of baking. Coming from an Asian household, where the appreciation for sugary indulgences was lacking, procuring cakes from outside proved to be an arduous task. The overwhelming sweetness of most commercial cakes was a deterrent. Determined to savor the perfect balance of flavors, I took it upon myself to master the craft of cake-making, granting me full control over the sugar content in each delectable creation.</p>

                <p>My aversion to dense cakes further fueled my passion for baking. As a result, I dedicated my efforts to perfecting the art of crafting irresistibly light and fluffy home-baked delights. With over six years of experience under my belt, I embarked on a new adventure by securing my first job at a local bakery in my cherished hometown.</p>
                    
                <p>The joy I derive from working at this establishment knows no bounds. It has become a cherished tradition for me to return each summer or whenever my schedule permits, eagerly offering my assistance whenever the bakery requires an extra hand.</p>

                    <p>
                        Towards the end of 2019, my fascination with video games began to blossom. However, this newfound passion came hand in hand with the requirement for a robust computer system capable of running the games I desired. Unfortunately, I lacked such a system, so I took it upon myself to construct one.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Dedicating an entire month to meticulous research, I delved into the realm of optimal hardware components that offered both performance and affordability. I scoured numerous YouTube videos and devoured countless articles to educate myself. As the Black Friday event emerged, I seized the opportunity and procured all the necessary components. Despite my sense of readiness fostered by the extensive video consumption, I frequently found myself revisiting the instructional clips.

                    <p>
                        This undertaking was an exhilarating yet nerve-wracking experience, as the components I sought were notably high-priced. However, this endeavor marked the beginning of a fulfilling journey, as I've made it a tradition to annually enhance and upgrade my PC setup ever since.
                    </p>

                    <p>This practice of annual upgrades to my PC has become somewhat of a tradition, resulting in a stockpile of spare components over the years. I ingeniously repurposed these spare parts to assemble a PC for my sister, extending the joy of immersive gaming to her as well.</p>

                <p>
                    During my freshman year of college, I set out on a coding journey that started as a casual interest. However, the deeper I dived into coding, the more I enjoyed its puzzle-solving aspect. I broadened my skills by mastering different languages, progressing from C++ to Java, C, C#, and Python. Along the way, I gained a wealth of knowledge, working on various projects. These included crafting personal websites using HTML & CSS, recreating games with C++, building websites with Python backends, and even creating an entire game using C# and Unity. Looking back, I've made significant progress, and I'm excited to take on more exciting projects. The aspiration to turn this journey into a lifelong career is a strong driving force for me.</p>

                <h1>Sewing</h1>
                <p>My love for DIY (do-it-yourself) projects took place when I wanted to create my own Halloween costume. Little did I know that this single endeavor would ignite a passion for sewing within me. Growing up with limited financial resources, the quest for affordable fabric became a necessity, leading me to discover the finest purveyors of inexpensive textiles in Los Angeles. Armed with my newfound expertise, I began crafting astonishing costumes that surpassed all expectations.</p>

                <p> Additionally, my adoration for Asian dramas, particularly historical ones, captivated my heart. Inspired by these tales, I undertook the extraordinary feat of creating a Hanfu, a traditional Chinese historical garment, with my own hands.</p> 
                    
                <p>During my college years, the exorbitant prices of formal dresses caught my attention. Determined not to be deterred by financial constraints, I embraced the challenge of fashioning my own exquisite attire. From that point forward, I have continuously delighted in the art of crafting my own dresses, reveling in the freedom of self-expression through fashion.
